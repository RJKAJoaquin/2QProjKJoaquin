            Climate Change is a change in the weather usually found in an area. Examples of this are temperatures increasing or decreasing throughout the year or simply a sunny day in an area mostly under rain throughout the year.
            Currently though, the Climate Change we're worried about is the average increase of heat across the globe. This is primarily due to Human Activities causing the Greenhouse effect, which blocks heat in the atmosphere from escaping.
            These activities include burning fossil fuels, decompositing waste, deforestation, and many, many more.

            <br>Climate Change affects more than just temperatures.

            <ul>
                <li>It can partially melt the glaciers, increasing the water level and potentially sinking entire cities or even countries</li>
                <li>It can increase the chance of extreme climate such as floods and droughts causing immense loss of life and food shortages</li>
                <li>It can acidify the ocean, harming the ocean wildlife and decreasing fish populations</li>
            </ul>

            and so many more if we don't do the best we could to prevent climate change. With that said, what can we do?
